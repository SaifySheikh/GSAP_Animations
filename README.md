# GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work across all major browsers. It is widely used for creating complex animations on the web, including page transitions, interactive elements, and loader animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with GSAP, you need to include the GSAP library in your project. You can do this by using a CDN or by downloading the library.

### Using CDN

Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.1/gsap.min.js"></script>
```

### Installation via NPM

If you're using Node.js, you can install GSAP via npm:

```bash
npm install gsap
```

Then, import it in your JavaScript file:

```javascript
import gsap from "gsap";
```

## Basic Usage

GSAP provides a simple syntax for creating animations. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```javascript
gsap.to(".element", { duration: 1, x: 100, opacity: 0.5 });
```

This code will animate the element with the class `.element` by moving it 100 pixels to the right and reducing its opacity to 0.5 over 1 second.

## GSAP Features

GSAP comes with a host of features that make it incredibly powerful:

- **Tweening**: Animate any numeric property of any object.
- **Timelines**: Sequence multiple animations.
- **Staggering**: Animate groups of elements with staggering effects.
- **Easing**: Apply easing functions to animations for more natural motion.
- **Plugins**: Extend GSAP's functionality with additional plugins like ScrollTrigger, MotionPathPlugin, and more.

## Stagger Animations

GSAP's `stagger` feature allows you to create animations that occur one after another with a delay. This is useful for animating lists, grids, or other groups of elements.

### Example: Staggered Animation

```javascript
gsap.from(".box", {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 50,
    duration: 1,
    stagger: 0.2
});
```

In this example, each element with the class `.box` will animate one after the other with a 0.2-second delay between them.

## Loader Animations

Loader animations are often used to indicate that content is being loaded in the background. GSAP makes it easy to create smooth and engaging loader animations.

### Basic Loader Animation

This example demonstrates a simple loader animation where dots scale up and down:

```html
<div class="loader">
    <div class="dot"></div>
    <div class="dot"></div>
    <div class="dot"></div>
</div>

<script>
    gsap.to(".dot", {
        y: -20,
        scale: 1.5,
        duration: 0.6,
        ease: "power1.inOut",
        repeat: -1,
        yoyo: true,
        stagger: 0.2
    });
</script>
```

### Anti-Clockwise Loader Animation

This example shows how to create an anti-clockwise loader animation:

```html
<div class="loader">
    <div class="dot dot1"></div>
    <div class="dot dot2"></div>
    <div class="dot dot3"></div>
</div>

<script>
    const tl = gsap.timeline({ repeat: -1 });

    tl.to(".dot2", { x: 65, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" })
      .to(".dot3", { x: -130, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" }, "-=0.5")
      .to(".dot1", { x: 65, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" }, "-=0.5")
      .to(".dot1", { x: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" })
      .to(".dot2", { x: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" }, "-=0.5")
      .to(".dot3", { x: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power1.inOut" }, "-=0.5");
</script>
```
